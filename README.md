# ARCHIVED
This project is archived because for me it's finished and I achieved my goal of writing my
first JIT (and I don't want to get dependency-warnings all the time from this project, lol).

# (ACTUALLY README)

A **R**ust Ch**ip-8** emulator written in rust! This little project should just
help me to write my first JIT-Compiler.

## Some notes
Thank you you people from [`iceed-x86`](https://crates.io/crates/iced-x86)! Your
crate makes it so much easier to write this emulator!
